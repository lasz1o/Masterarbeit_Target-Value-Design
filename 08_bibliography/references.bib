Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Einer dieser Ansätze sind Modelle der Integrierten Projektabwicklung (IPA), die international seit Ende der 1990er-Jahre zum Einsatz kommen und seit 2018 auch in Deutschland im Rahmen von Pilotprojekten erprobt werden. Die Autoren verfolgen mit diesem Beitrag das Ziel aus ihrer wissenschaftlichen Befassung mit diesem Projektabwicklungsmodell und ihren Erfahrungen in der Praxis einen Strukturierungsansatz für IPA zu entwickeln. Dieser Ansatz soll einen Beitrag dazu leisten, ein besseres Verständnis für die Besonderheiten dieses Modells und dessen Funktionsweise zu erlangen. Zugleich kann dies Grundlage für die Entwicklung einer Taxonomie und für die Einordnung weiterer Forschungsarbeit sein. Der hier vorgeschlagene Strukturierungsansatz wird basierend auf einer umfassenden Literaturrecherche, bereits vorhandener Strukturierungsansätze und den Erfahrungen der Autoren aus dem Dialog mit Vertretern aus Wissenschaft und Praxis erarbeitet.

            In the construction industry, approaches have been sought for a long time to improve the achievement of project goals for clients and users of construction works and at the same time to increase the level of collaboration and productivity for those involved in the project. One of these approaches is Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), which has been used internationally since the late 1990s and has also been tested in pilot projects in Germany since 2018. In this paper, the authors pursue the goal of developing an approach to structure IPD. This is based on their scientific engagement with this project delivery model and their experiences in practice. The approach is intended to contribute to a better understanding of the specifics of this model and how it works. At the same time it can be the basis for developing a taxonomy and for classifying further research. The approach for the structure of IPD proposed here is developed based on a comprehensive literature review, existing approaches, and the authors‘ experience from dialog with representatives from academia and practice.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction in 2002, Target Value Design (TVD) has become more commonly used and accepted by the construction industry in the United States. Several researchers have reported that TVD projects are good at maintaining a predictable project cost and controlling cost overruns. The case studies, reported in the literature, show that TVD projects have generally been completed at 15\% to 20\% below market price without compromising schedule or quality. Little research, however, has been conducted to generalize the findings to the wider population of TVD projects. No statistical analysis has been conducted to compare TVD projects with projects that do not use TVD. In this paper, we present the results of several statistical analyses on a sample set of 47 TVD projects. We compared cost overrun (spent-budget ratio) and contingency percentage of these TVD projects with a dataset of non-TVD projects from the Construction Industry Institute. The results show that TVD projects are less likely to go over budget even though the contingency of TVD projects is less than that on non-TVD projects. A theory is introduced to explain the findings from the statistical analysis. The theory and the findings were presented to industry leaders in the AEC industry and their feedback was incorporated into this paper.},

Current target value practices are also cost-centric, sidelining other aspects of performance value. Maturity models have been used to introduce consistency in Lean practices implementation. This paper presents a target value maturity model (TVMM) that aims to support consistent target value practices. It defines target value functions and processes that drive design toward holistic performance targets beyond cost. The TVMM was developed through a structure maturity model creation methodology. It specifies four maturity functions: value planning, control, alignment, and learning, and further defines fifteen target value attributes. Project teams can assess their maturity across six levels from nonexistent, to initial, managed, defined, quantitatively managed, and optimized. The model was internally evaluated through three iterations. Clarity on target value functions presented in the model can support consistent implementation and assessment of target value practices in the design phase of projects. The model can also guide alignment of design efforts with targets. Future work will validate this model with industry experts and a case study project.},

	abstract = {In the current construction industry scenario, several constraints schedule, scope, cost - impact the quality of products delivered. From the clients’ and users’ perspectives, there is a need to incorporate innovative methods for value management in the sector. Delivering products with more added value often runs into investor restrictions and difficulties imposed by a fragmented product development process, representing obstacles to collaboration among stakeholders, especially in the real estate context. These characteristics demand a proactive design process focusesed on value delivery. One of them is Target Value Design (TVD), which has emerged as a viable solution to solve the poor performance in construction. Most TVD applications reported are cases where the owner sets the goals based on the available budget and desired functionalities. This research aims to develop a TVD model adapted for real estate projects, specifically for products with units for sale. In this context, one single company combines different roles, acting as developer and contractor and being responsible for sales to final users. The market, and not the owner, defines the target value and cost. The study was developed in Brazil, where this arrangement is very common, but can provide insights into other countries with similar characteristics. For this purpose, this research adopted the Design Science Research (DSR) strategy, which seeks to explain, describe, explore, or prescribe solutions for real-life problems. Focus Groups technique helped to develop and validate the artifact through learning cycles. As a result, the research proposes a TVD-adapted model and guidelines for implementation in the real estate market.},

	abstract = {Over the years, construction projects have been developed and delivered through traditional delivery methods. However, traditional delivery methods have been considered ineffective to achieve the real project goals. Integrated and collaborative models, such as Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), a delivery method based on relational contracts, has attracted growing interest in both academia and industry, but still scarce in Architecture Engineering, and Construction (AEC). Most prior research emphasized the identification of barriers and challenges to implementing IPD and few studies focused on developing strategies to overcome those constraints. A limited number of studies have addressed how to reap the benefits of IPD in AEC environments where collaboration between stakeholders is poor. This research investigates how to integrate IPD into AEC projects when collaboration is still limited. An “IPD Evolutionary Model” and guidelines for its implementation were developed for applications in such environments. Design Science Research was the research approach adopted in this study to discuss and evaluate the proposed model. The model emphasizes an evolutionary and flexible process for the IPD application in AEC projects. The model postulates the desirable and required IPD elements according to the levels of application difficulty, emphasising stakeholders' readiness for using it and the gradual introduction of IPD in such environments.},

To address this topic in a systematic and scientific way, Design Science Research (DSR) has established itself as an appropriate research method. There are many different variations of DSR, on different levels of complexity and detail, but all are based on an iterative approach of designing the desired artefact and evaluating it. This makes it difficult for many students to get an understanding of DSR in order to use it for their thesis (on bachelor or master level). The goal of the current paper therefore is to provide a short introduction to DSR for these students, based on the DSR variant described by (Österle et al., 2010) which is considered fairly basic and easy to understand and use. We do not try to introduce any new approach to DSR but provide a short introduction to this existing variant of DSR.},

	abstract = {In the current construction industry scenario, several constraints schedule, scope, cost - impact the quality of products delivered. From the clients’ and users’ perspectives, there is a need to incorporate innovative methods for value management in the sector. Delivering products with more added value often runs into investor restrictions and difficulties imposed by a fragmented product development process, representing obstacles to collaboration among stakeholders, especially in the real estate context. These characteristics demand a proactive design process focusesed on value delivery. One of them is Target Value Design (TVD), which has emerged as a viable solution to solve the poor performance in construction. Most TVD applications reported are cases where the owner sets the goals based on the available budget and desired functionalities. This research aims to develop a TVD model adapted for real estate projects, specifically for products with units for sale. In this context, one single company combines different roles, acting as developer and contractor and being responsible for sales to final users. The market, and not the owner, defines the target value and cost. The study was developed in Brazil, where this arrangement is very common, but can provide insights into other countries with similar characteristics. For this purpose, this research adopted the Design Science Research (DSR) strategy, which seeks to explain, describe, explore, or prescribe solutions for real-life problems. Focus Groups technique helped to develop and validate the artifact through learning cycles. As a result, the research proposes a TVD-adapted model and guidelines for implementation in the real estate market.},

Teams need to communicate, collaborate, and make decisions not solely based on ﬁrst cost considerations. For this purpose, Target Value Design (TVD) related practices are being used to deliver green buildings in Southern California while meeting strict code requirements and addressing the needs of multiple stakeholders in a collaborative fashion. This study did not quantify costs associated with design and construction of sustainable buildings. It used an analytical process that compared and contrasted available literature on TVD and interviews with industry practitioners to investigate the use of TVD-inspired practices in the construction industry in Southern California and identify the current use of TVD-inspired practices in the design of green buildings. The study revealed that, even though practitioners might not be aware of how TVD can be fully implemented in these projects, a number of TVD-inspired practices are currently being used. Examples are provided to illustrate their practical use in the design of sustainable buildings and how practice compares to theory regarding TVD implementation.},

	abstract = {Die Bedeutung des ‚Baus‘ kann auf verschiedene Weise herausgestellt werden. Sei es der Anteil der nominalen Bauinvestitionen am Bruttoinlandsprodukt Deutschlands von rd. 10\%, der Anteil der Branche an Treibhausgasemissionen, der je nach Betrachtungsweise zwischen 30\% und 50\% liegt, oder aber die Versorgung der Gesellschaft mit Infrastruktur. Es wird deutlich, wie wichtig Forschung und Entwicklung im Bauwesen für die Gesellschaft ist. Noch deutlicher wird der Bedarf, wenn man die konstante oder leicht sinkende Arbeitsproduktivität im Baugewerbe registriert, während in anderen Branchen Innovationssprünge und Effizienzsteigerungen teilweise zu beträchtlichen Steigerungen der Arbeitsproduktivität führen. Auch eine immer noch schleppende Digitalisierung im Planen und Bauen oder eine häufig von Kostenüberschreitungen, Verzögerungen und Konflikten gehemmte Projektabwicklung sind Bereiche, in denen die Baubranche hinter anderen Branchen zurückbleibt. Um diesen Entwicklungen entgegen zu wirken, wird an den Lehrstühlen der über 40 Professor*innen des BBB-Netzwerks in der DACH-Region geforscht. Wie vielfältig die Themenbereiche des Bauens und die damit verbundene Forschung sein können, lässt sich durch einen Blick auf das Inhaltsverzeichnis des Tagungsbandes nur erahnen. Sie reichen von der Lehre, über die Digitalisierung und Simulation von Prozessen, der robotergestützten Fertigung bis hin zur Anwendung von KI-Methoden im Bauwesen. Die Ergebnisse und Zwischenstände der wissenschaftlichen Auseinandersetzung mit den unterschiedlichen Themenbereichen werden u.a. jährlich im Rahmen der BBB Assistent*innen-Tagung vorgestellt und diskutiert. Vom 02. bis 04.07.2025 fand die 34. BBB Assistent*innen-Tagung an der Technischen Universität Berlin statt. Gastgeber war das Fachgebiet Bauwirtschaft und Baubetrieb mit Unterstützung des InnovationsZentrums Bau e.V.. Ziel der Tagung ist es, Doktorand*innen und wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter*innen der Fachbereiche Baubetrieb, Bauwirtschaft und Baumanagement einen Rahmen für Austausch und Vernetzung zu geben. Neben dem wissenschaftlichen Diskurs, bietet die BBB Assistent*innen-Tagung die Möglichkeit, die gastgebende Hochschule, deren Lehrbetrieb und die dort aktuellen Forschungsprojekte kennenzulernen. Dieses Format kann somit eine Ausgangsbasis für die Initiierung von hochschulübergreifenden Kooperationen sein und bietet Inspiration und Anknüpfungspunkte für neue Forschungsfragen im Bauwesen.},

	abstract = {Target costing is an effective management technique that has been used in manufacturing for decades to achieve cost predictability during new product development. Adoption of this technique promises beneﬁts for the construction industry as it struggles to raise the number of successful outcomes and certainty of project delivery in terms of cost, quality and time. Target value design is a management approach that takes the best features of target costing and adapts them to the peculiarities of construction. The concept of target value design is introduced based on the results of action research carried out on 12 construction projects in the USA. It has been shown that systemic application of target value design leads to signiﬁcant improvement of project performance——the ﬁnal cost of projects was on average 15\% less than market cost. The construction industry already has approaches that have similarities with elements of the target value design process or use the same terminology, e.g. partnering and target cost contracts, cost planning, etc. Following an exploration of the similarities and differences target value design is positioned as a form of target costing for construction that offers a more reliable route to successful project outcomes.},

	abstract = {Knappe Investitionsbudgets und hohe ökologische Anforderungen führen zu klassischen Zielkonflikten in Projekten. Insbesondere bei der Anwendung des Target Value Designs (TVD) liegt der Fokus stark auf der Einhaltung der Kosten. Dementsprechend haben ökologische Ziele, wenn sie als Ergänzung zu Funktionalität und Qualität betrachtet werden, kaum eine Chance, erreicht zu werden. Auch eine kurzzyklische Berücksichtigung von Ökobilanzfaktoren oder Energieeffizienz in frühen Planungsphasen kann den Zielkonflikt zwischen ökonomischen und ökologischen Zielen nicht lösen. So bleibt unklar, wie entschieden werden soll, wenn ökologische und ökonomische Ziele unvereinbar erscheinen. Ebenso ist ungeklärt, wie soziale Faktoren in die TVD einbezogen werden können. Um diese Probleme zu lösen, wurde das Target Sustainability Design (TSD) entwickelt. Dazu wurde das TVD in seine Komponenten zerlegt und mit den Faktoren der starken Nachhaltigkeit so kombiniert, dass ökologische und soziale Nachhaltigkeitsziele integraler Bestandteil der TSD-Methode werden. Die Ziele aller drei Dimensionen der Nachhaltigkeit können bei der Anwendung der TSD-Methode nicht gegeneinander ausgespielt, sondern nur gemeinsam erreicht werden. In diesem Beitrag wird die Zusammensetzung der TSD-Methode vorgestellt und ihre Wirkungsweise anhand eines Fallbeispiels illustriert.},

Method: Description and analysis of action research \& learning in current practice. Findings: In the context of Lean Project Delivery with Target Value Design (TVD) projects are completed below market cost—so far as much as 19\% below and expected cost falls as design and construction progresses. Limitations: this work is based on a limited number of linked cases in the US over the last 10 years. We suggest the ideas are applicable far more widely. Implications: there is still more development and research required to develop effective leadership models for integrated design and delivery, create wholeoflife Target Value Design, to create significant bodies of evidence to guide the design of many building types and to further develop the Lean Project Delivery System. Value for practitioners: initial indications are that the methods described work together to deliver significant benefits for owners/clients/end-users and create a more satisfying experience for most designers and constructors.},

This study analyzes the research trends on the field of IPD to provide an appropriate vision for future researchers in this specialized field. While so far no comprehensive research has been done in this field, this study provides a comprehensive review of existing studies through in-depth literature review method. This research evaluates studies conducted in the field of IPD, which is a basis for future researchers to improve conditions of IPD implementation in different countries. For that this study Using library studies, the trend of researches conducted on various concepts and domains during various years, has been investigated. Future studies can simply use the outputs of this research to shape their research flow on establishing continuing progress of IPD. The data obtained from descriptive analyses are illustrated quantitatively, followed by comprehensive analyses and discussion of the results. Moreover, this study concluded that during recent years, the trend of studies conducted about IPD has increased, particularly articles examined challenges. In the next step, more studies have been performed in the field of construction. Those articles are preferred that have evaluated principles, challenges, and solutions for resolving barriers. Proper IPD implementation facilitates enhanced share of information and early identification of stakeholders through a proper timing as vital keys to realize objectives of the construction projects, reduce risks, and increase the chance of project success.},

	abstract = {Target value design (TVD) is a management approach that applies target costing in the design and construction industry. TVD enables a project environment with favorable characteristics to generate value. However, because the TVD’s primary assessment is cost, target cost can be met without necessarily achieving the project’s full value. This research applies the action research approach to implement TVD in a housing project and explores the value generation of the project using a value analysis model (VAM) to study the balance between cost and value fulfillment in the product and design process. According to the results, even though the target cost was achieved, the desired value of the project was not achieved during the project design. However, there is a tendency to increase value over time to a greater extent in the product and not so much in the process. The main contributions of this study are the possibility of comparing cost and value, identifying the emphasis of product over process and cost over value throughout the TVD project. This study enhances the literature on project value generation and maximization, offering new knowledge for a better understanding of how to conduct a value analysis in combination with costing in TVD projects.},

	abstract = {Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is currently being propagated in Germany as a project delivery model that leads complex projects to greater cost and schedule security and to a partnership-based approach between all parties. According to the IPA Center, the IPD has eight characteristics. One characteristic is the incentive system, which is further subdivided into: jointly confirmed target costs, joint risk sharing, reimbursement of costs actually incurred, payment of selected remuneration components, depending on the achievement of project goals and opportunities and risks that have occurred. The focus of this paper is on the compensation model and its incentive system. The aim of the paper is to identify other potential compensation models for IPD and to present their advantages and disadvantages. Contractual models for the IPA with a balanced distribution of risk prove to be the most suitable for this project delivery model. These include cost-reimbursement contracts, which offer different incentive systems such as a profit mark-up, target achievement bonus, and many more. Also special kinds of the Firm Fixed Price Contract.},

	abstract = {Case studies have been developed and used in teaching and training for more than 100 years. They have widely been used in business and law schools. The use of case studies has become popular in engineering and construction education with evidence of tens of papers reporting the efficacy of the case study method published in the proceedings of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) annual conferences. The Associated General Contractors (AGC) Education and Research Foundation (AGCERF) started the development of construction case studies for educational purposes in 2011 and has published 16 of them, including various construction topics from ethics to mobile technology. A multitude of “how to write a teaching case study” guidelines are available, including in construction education. However, literature that provides insights into developing a specific case study in construction engineering and management is scarce. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents the dynamics of developing an educational case study to explore the implementation of target value design (TVD). This case study was developed for engineering and construction management students to formulate, discuss, and decide on strategies, actions, and solutions to provide the best value to the project owner when implementing TVD. This work-in-progress paper focuses on the pilot test when developing the case study. Pre-class engagement, in-class collaborative learning strategies and post-class comprehensive student feedback in addition to instructor’s observation and reflection were employed in the pilot test – an important step in developing an effective educational case study.},
